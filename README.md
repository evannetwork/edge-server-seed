# SmartAgents

SmartAgents work more or less the same as the SmartAgents in vanilla [ActionHero](https://www.actionherojs.com/), with two exceptions:

- there is the api.redis object available for local storage
- there is the api.bcc object available that serves as the interface to the blockchain-core
- the agents that perform transactions or need to access encrypted data have to
  configure the necessary keys in the base level `ethAccounts` and `encryptionKeys` config
  mappings

    ```javascript
    ethAccounts: {
        'accountID' : 'privatekey',
    },
    encryptionKeys: {
        'hash':'encryptionkey',
    }
    ```

The hash to index for encryptionKeys is constructed by the blockchain core in different ways for the
different puposes, But usually it is just a SHA3 hash of an accountID or of a descriptive string.
